Brief description

processClip: 
	driver of all

diff3: 
	positive differences between frames. Assumes ball is white. So a pixel turning white in next frame will light up(255) while one turning dark leave nothing(0).
	Two step differences (1st one between frames, both positive and negative diff, 2nd one between results of 1st one to remove duplication) did not work well.

findblob: 
	LoG for finding blobs. No longer in use. Too slow and too many matches.

findball: 
	find candidates by looking at connected regions (px val=255). Prunes regions by area, ratio, compactness.

nneighbours: 
	connects nearest neighbours. For each candidate find (within next 2 frames) the nearest neighbours and assigns them a same group id (connected).

recfit: 
	originally named after recursive searching and curve fitting. Turned out to be working by guessing ball locations beyond connected candidates. Specifically, it maintains a push pop queue. For each group in queue fit a curve on group and crop two ends at ~20 frames beyond group bondaries. Then slide the curve vertically to create an area/surface/cage. Other groups that has enough amount of its points falling in this cage gets merged with current group.
